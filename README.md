## b u b b l e s : The Anti-Social Media App 

o Unlike Facebook and Instagram, Bubbles is a social media application which allows users to connect within the Bubbles community without requiring profiles to have centralized content and friend list. 

o With Bubbles, each user can create multiple “bubbles”. A single bubble contains a localized friend list and shared content. Each bubble can be categorized in a color coded group, such as friends, families, coworkers etc. No other user will be able to see your bubbles. 

o Within each bubble, a user can participate in a group chat and feed, where they can share images, URLs, and videos for all members to view. 

## Why Use Bubbles? 
o Unlike other social media applications, Bubbles emphasize and stress the importance of User privacy. 

## Privacy and Intimacy 
o Each user's profile and bubbles are kept private. Users cannot search for other user profiles, or join other bubbles without admin invitation. 

o Joining Bubbles is easy. Only an email and age verification is required, no further information is needed.
